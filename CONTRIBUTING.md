# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and any help that can be offered is greatly appreciated.
Please take a moment to read the entire contributing guide.

This repository uses the [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow),
meaning that development should take place in `feat/` branches, with the `master` branch kept in a stable state.
When you submit pull requests, please make sure to fork from and submit back to `master`.

Other processes and specifications that are in use in this repository are:

-   [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
-   [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) following the @commitlint/config-conventional config
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) style guide

## Getting Started

Ensure you have all prerequisites installed (including any optional ones), as noted in the [prerequisites section of the readme file](./README.md#prerequisites).

With those in place, you can fork the repository, clone it, and then run `npm ci` to install all dependencies.
Make a copy of `.env.template` in the root directory and rename it to `.env`, configuring the environment variables in the file as required.

### Development Workflow

After cloning the repository and installing all the dependencies, there are several commands available for local development:

-   `npm run lint` - Lints everything in src directory
-   `npm run jest` - Runs Jest over all tests in src directory
-   `npm test` - Runs `npm run lint` and `npm run jest` together
-   `npm run start:dev` - Starts a development server with live reload, available on `localhost:8204` unless you specify your own port

### Production Workflow

-   `npm start` - Runs a production version. No live reload.

## Documentation Style

Documentation (both in markdown files and inline comments) should be written in **British English** where possible.

Titles and headings should adhere to the [Associated Press (AP)](https://www.apstylebook.com/) style:

-   Capitalise words with three or more letters
-   Capitalise the first and the last word
-   Capitalise nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions
-   Lowercase articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions
-   Capitalise words with four or more letters (including conjunctions and prepositions)

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a pull request back to the main repository, please make sure you have completed the following steps:

1. Pull request base branch is set to `master`. All pull requests should be forked from and merged back to `master`
2. Run `npm test` to check the code adheres to the defined ESLint style and that it passes the Jest tests
3. Run `npm run lint:prettier` to run the Prettier code formatter over the code
4. Run `npm run lint:licenses` if adding or updating production dependencies to check they use permissive licenses

Steps 2. and 4. are automatically run by a pre-commit hook added by [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/).

## Issues

Please file your issues [here](https://github.com/Fdawgs/docsmith/issues) and try to provide as much information in the template as possible/relevant.
